Postmortem Report: Service Outage of November 10, 2023 "the smurfs smurfing in the server's room, accidentally pulled a cord they should not"
Issue Summary:
Duration: 7h hell for the small smurfs (from 14:00 AM to 9:50 PM UTC) causing bed performance of our web application.
Impact: angry birds chriping our call center chieftian's ears off?
Root Cause: someone somewhere in our little smurf vilage moved a block where they should not and did not put the block properly in new place. poor api v1 got a middle age crisses and wants to act like the new teenager v3.
Timeline:
angry birds sent alot of stones and logs (calls and tickets)
call center chieftian are old and slow and could not handle the load.
the villain smurfs panicks but were was enough to bring a similar book that is missing (reverting to last working version before code changes)
our resident sorceers (senior engineers) caught wind of the mischive, cast thier spells (analyside new code) and found the curse *(spagutti code of juniors)
smurfs tried to free.
sorcerss captured the smurfs, and now they simmer in cauldrons as they reflect on what they did wrong.
web app no longer has bed performance issues.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes( how not to simmer in cauldron again):
treat mistress web app gently and always check for reaction and resonable course of action, especially with women.
strict CI/CD
